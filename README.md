## RTBTS Mobile Application

Trip Module – this is an application made for android phone for setting bus status (arrived, departed, cancelled, on-standby, loading-Passenger), making a new trip base on the schedule, and update it to the database server. This will be installed on the conductor’s android phone in which he/she will have the authority to update the website for passengers (users) view on the on-going trips in the terminal. They can only be authorized when they have a schedule assigned by their bus company. To update the status and trips on the website, the application will require internet access.
